My journey into Web Development started when I needed a website for my Business in 2016. I was selling VR headsets at that time. I just googled "How to build a Website"...I also googled "How to build a multimillion-dollar empire"... And I did first, and almost the second. I became fascinated with the power of coding. I'm pursuing my passion ever since!

Skills/Interests: JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Django, Flask, SQL, UX/UI, CSS, SASS, HTML5, multimillion-dollar empire.
